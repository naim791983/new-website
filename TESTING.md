# Testing the Interactive Panel Functionality

## Overview
This document explains how to test the enhanced interactive panel functionality that was implemented for the Bobinage Platform.

## Features Implemented
1. Two main buttons: "AT 3600 Electric Control" and "Training"
2. Interactive panel with four sub-buttons:
   - Work Instructions
   - Visual AD Videos
   - Work Rules
   - Safety Guidelines
3. "Browse Files" button that appears after clicking any sub-button
4. Full file browsing functionality with action logging

## How to Test

### Method 1: Using the Test Page
1. Open `test-panel.html` in your web browser
2. Click either of the two main buttons ("AT 3600 Electric Control" or "Training")
3. A panel will appear with the four sub-buttons
4. Click any of the sub-buttons
5. A "Browse Files" button will appear
6. Click the "Browse Files" button to open a file dialog
7. Select one or more files to test the functionality
8. Check the browser console (F12) to see logged actions
9. Click "View Action Logs" to see all logged actions in a formatted view

### Method 2: Using the Dashboard
1. Open `dashboard.html` in your web browser (after logging in)
2. Click either of the floating action buttons at the bottom right
3. Follow steps 3-8 from Method 1

## What to Expect
- When you click the main buttons, the panel opens with the correct title
- When you click any sub-button, the "Browse Files" button appears
- When you click "Browse Files", a file dialog opens
- When you select files, you'll see:
  - An alert showing how many files were selected
  - Console logs with details about each action
  - Entries in the action logs storage

## Action Logging
All user interactions are logged with the following information:
- Action type (button click, file selection, etc.)
- Timestamp
- Context information (which panel, which button, file details, etc.)

Logs are stored in the browser's localStorage and can be viewed using the "View Action Logs" button on the test page.

## Technical Implementation
The functionality is implemented in `js/interactive-panel.js` with the following key features:
- Event listeners for all buttons
- File dialog handling
- Action logging to both console and localStorage
- Proper panel opening/closing behavior
- Support for multiple file selection
